I'm a staff software engineer and former educator with a passion for solving complex integration and data problems. I love building systems that connect disparate pieces of technology. I'm a language enthusiast, and have written production code in C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and PHP. 
### What you'll find here
A mix of side projects in various stages of completion—I love taking real-world problems from family, friends, and my own work and building more streamlined solutions. Current interests include laboratory information management systems, campaign technology, and anything involving database optimization or complex data workflows.
