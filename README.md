### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the integrations team at Drip!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby on Rails.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data projects (especially for scientific research) and civic open source code.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with how to add CI/CD to my projects with as little pain as possible. (Love Netlify for my blog!)
- 💬 Ask me about Hacktoberfest, NaNoGenMo, Advent of Code...or less tech-oriented - hiking, cooking, and my favorite tv shows.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
